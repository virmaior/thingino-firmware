WPA-supplicant Disconnect Reason Codes
--------------------------------------
* reason=1 "Unspecified reason"
* reason=2 "Previous authentication no longer valid"
* reason=3 "Deauthenticated because sending STA is leaving (or has left) the BSS"
* reason=4 "Disassociated due to inactivity"
* reason=5 "Disassociated because AP is unable to handle all currently associated STAs"
* reason=6 "Class 2 frame received from nonauthenticated STA"
* reason=7 "Class 3 frame received from nonassociated STA"
* reason=8 "Disassociated because sending STA is leaving (or has left) BSS"
* reason=9 "STA requesting (re)association is not authenticated with responding STA"
* reason=10 "Disassociated because the information in the Power Capability element is unacceptable"
* reason=11 "Disassociated because the information in the Supported Channels element is unacceptable"
* reason=12 "Disassociated due to BSS transition management"
* reason=13 "Invalid information element, i.e., an information element defined in this standard for which the content does not meet the specifications in Clause 9"
* reason=14 "Message integrity code (MIC) failure"
* reason=15 "4-Way handshake timeout"
* reason=16 "Group key handshake timeout"
* reason=17 "Element in 4-Way handshake different from (Re)Association Request/Probe Response/Beacon frame"
* reason=18 "Invalid group cipher"
* reason=19 "Invalid pairwise cipher"
* reason=20 "Invalid AKMP"
* reason=21 "Unsupported RSN information element version"
* reason=22 "Invalid RSN information element capabilities"
* reason=23 "IEEE 802.1X authentication failed"
* reason=24 "Cipher suite rejected because of the security policy"
* reason=25 "TDLS direct-link teardown due to TDLS peer STA unreachable via the TDLS direct link"
* reason=26 "TDLS direct-link teardown for unspecified reason"
* reason=27 "Disassociated because session terminated by SSP request"
* reason=28 "Disassociated because of lack of SSP roaming agreement"
* reason=29 "Requested service rejected because of SSP cipher suite or AKM requirement "
* reason=30 "Requested service not authorized in this location"
* reason=31 "TS deleted because QoS AP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QoS STA due to a change in BSS service characteristics or operational mode"
* reason=32 "Disassociated for unspecified, QoS-related reason"
* reason=33 "Disassociated because QoS AP lacks sufficient bandwidth for this QoS STA"
* reason=34 "Disassociated because excessive number of frames need to be acknowledged, but are not acknowledged due to AP transmissions and/or poor channel conditions"
* reason=35 "Disassociated because STA is transmitting outside the limits of its TXOPs"
* reason=36 "Requested from peer STA as the STA is leaving the BSS (or resetting)"
* reason=37 "Requesting STA is no longer using the stream or session"
* reason=38 "Requesting STA received frames using a mechanism for which a setup has not been completed"
* reason=39 "Requested from peer STA due to timeout"
* reason=45 "Peer STA does not support the requested cipher suite" [reason 45 is no longer in Wiresharkâ€™s list]
* reason=46 "Disassociated because authorized access limit reached"
* reason=47 "Disassociated due to external service requirements"
* reason=48 "Invalid FT Action frame count"
* reason=49 "Invalid pairwise master key identifier (PMKID)"
* reason=50 "Invalid MDE"
* reason=51 "Invalid FTE"
* reason=52 "Mesh peering canceled for unknown reasons"
* reason=53 "The mesh STA has reached the supported maximum number of peer mesh STAs"
* reason=54 "The received information violates the Mesh Configuration policy configured in the mesh STA profile"
* reason=55 "The mesh STA has received a Mesh Peering Close message requesting to close the mesh peering"
* reason=56 "The mesh STA has re-sent dot11MeshMaxRetries Mesh Peering Open messages, without receiving a Mesh Peering Confirm message"
* reason=57 "The confirmTimer for the mesh peering instance times out"
* reason=58 "The mesh STA fails to unwrap the GTK or the values in the wrapped contents do not match"
* reason=59 "The mesh STA receives inconsistent information about the mesh parameters between Mesh Peering Management frames"
* reason=60 "The mesh STA fails the authenticated mesh peering exchange because due to failure in selecting either the pairwise ciphersuite or group ciphersuite"
* reason=61 "The mesh STA does not have proxy information for this external destination"
* reason=62 "The mesh STA does not have forwarding information for this destination"
* reason=63 "The mesh STA determines that the link to the next hop of an active path in its forwarding information is no longer usable"
* reason=64 "The Deauthentication frame was sent because the MAC address of the STA already exists in the mesh BSS. See 11.3.3 (Additional mechanisms for an AP collocated with a mesh STA)"
* reason=65 "The mesh STA performs channel switch to meet regulatory requirements"
* reason=66 "The mesh STA performs channel switch with unspecified reason"
* reason=67 "Transmission link establishment in alternative channel failed"
* reason=68 "The alternative channel is occupied"
* reason=71 "Disassociated due to poor RSSI."
